        <h2>Their lives depend on your donation</h2>
        <p>More than 4.3 million people are impacted by the sudden flash flood and water congestion (WHO). Meanwhile, millions have been marooned, more than 9 million are homeless, and displaced women and girls are now particularly vulnerable whilst they shelter out in the open or in unfamiliar locations. Many communities also face the added challenge of a total lack of electricity, meaning they are then unable to keep in contact with family members and friends to ensure their safety.</p>
